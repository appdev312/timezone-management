[ Write an application that shows time in different timezones ]

- User must be able to create an account and log in.
- When logged in, user can see, edit and delete timezones he entered 
  Implement at least two roles with different permission levels (ie: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on his owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, an admin would be able to CRUD on all records and users, etc.) 
- When a timezone is entered, each entry has a Name, Name of city in timezone, difference to GMT time 
- When displayed, each entry has also current time 
- Filter by names 
- REST API. 
  Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you donâ€™t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API). 
- All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile app, disregard this) 
- In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
